It is designed to be controlled by an Ableton Push Controller by using the [jk.push package](https://jeffkaiser.com/product/jk-push-software-for-interacting-with-ableton-push-in-cycling-74s-max-environment/) by Jeff Kaiser.

The Project builds upon architectures developed at acids-ircam: [RAVE](github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE) and [vschaos2](https://github.com/acids-ircam/vschaos2) and implements them by using the [nn~-External](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde).

No trained model is included in this repo.
